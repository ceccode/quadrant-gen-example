# Quadrant Chart Generator - Sample Flask app

A simple Flask web application that allows you to generate quadrant charts from CSV data using the [quadrant-gen library](https://pypi.org/project/quadrant-gen/0.2.0/)

## Features

- Upload CSV data directly in the browser
- Customize chart title and axis labels
- Generate charts in PNG or PDF format
- View charts in the browser or download them

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quadrant-gen-example
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Testing the Installation

First, activate the virtual environment and run the test script:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_quadrant_gen.py
```

## Running the App

Activate the virtual environment and start the Flask app:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5001/

**Note**: Always activate the virtual environment before running any commands to ensure the correct dependencies are loaded.
